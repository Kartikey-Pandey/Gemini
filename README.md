# GEMINI CLONE

A Gemini clone website is a replication or imitation of Gemini, a minimalist web protocol designed for a lightweight and simplified browsing experience. Unlike traditional web protocols like HTTP/HTTPS, Gemini focuses on delivering plain text content with a limited set of formatting options, prioritizing privacy, and reducing complexity
